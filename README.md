# Excel-Interactive-Lesson

This was my first time using VBA to help with teaching my peers on the use of some basic Excel functions that I found useful.

## Thought process

This started out as a fun project for me to work on my skills writing in VBA. I was trying to find a way to help people learn some of the basic functions
of Excel that I found useful.  
I had thought of gamifying it as I felt it would be a fun way to learn new concepts. It took a while but I managed to make the lessons randomized to allow repitition.
